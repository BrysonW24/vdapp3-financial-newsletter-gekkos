## The 272 Chart System

### Core Philosophy

> "Charts keep you honest. Fundamentals generate the idea. Technicals decide whether you should act on it."
> — Stan Druckenmiller

Druckenmiller's approach combines:
- **75-80% fundamental analysis** - Deep macro research and conviction
- **20-25% technical confirmation** - Charts verify timing and conviction
- **High conviction, concentrated bets** - When both align, bet big

### Daily Review Process

**Time:** ~4:30 PM daily
**Volume:** 272 charts
**Duration:** Comprehensive review of global markets
**Purpose:** Identify trends, confirm theses, spot opportunities

Each chart category is viewed across **three timeframes** for comprehensive trend analysis:

### Daily Charts (8-20 Day Prediction)
- **Purpose:** Short-term trend identification
- **Signals:** Entry/exit timing, momentum shifts
- **Use Case:** Tactical positioning, near-term risk management

- **Signals:** Primary trend direction, swing positions
- **Use Case:** Position sizing decisions, trend confirmation

- **Purpose:** Long-term structural trends
- **Signals:** Major regime changes, multi-year themes
- **Use Case:** Strategic allocation, macro themes

### Why 8-20 Periods?

Druckenmiller uses the **8-20 period range** because:

- **20 periods** = Maximum typical trend duration before reversal/consolidation
- Aligns with natural market cycles
- Provides actionable forecast windows
